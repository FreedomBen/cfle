- Notification to slack/email for renewals
- Multiple namespaces in `NAMESPACE`
- Store exp date in annotation on the secret so we can intelligently decide when to run it
  - If no cert exists run immediately
  - If cert exists, check it's expiration date with openssl or with the annotation
  - Renew cert if within 30 days of expiring
